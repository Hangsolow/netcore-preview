This repository is a fork of https://github.com/episerver/netcore-preview intended to be used in blogs post and the like for doing dotnet 5 samples.

All the packages have been updated to latest version as of 2021-12-28 and most of the compiler warnings have been fixed (except for the 'ICreditCardPayment' is obsolete warning in the commerce project)


## The solution

Use your user directory on Windows, or add Everyone to the folder where you created the repository. The Alloy and Quicksilver sample sites are both using localdb, so you need to have the correct permissions.

`NOTE: Quicksilver has a default username and password of admin@example.com / Episerver123!`
